          <span class="attribution"><p>— Julia Powles and Enrique Chaparro, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search

        <p>Our project aims to direct attention to the recent developments in internet regulation in the United States, specifically in relation to “The Right to Be Forgotten”.</p>

        <p>We will do so by creating a web-presence for a fictional delisting service to American consumers. This type of service, already existing in Europe (eg. <a href="http://www.reputationvip.com/" target="_blank">http://www.reputationvip.com/</a> ), claims to help users “control their onine reputation and protect their professional image”  by  delisting search engine results that they feel are negative.</p>

        <p>Because of the regulation governing search engines’ US sites, services like these are not currently a reality in America. As users interact with our false company’s advertisements, online-presence and online customer (bot-driven) service, they will encounter facts and articles about America’s current position in Delisting, and realize that the service is fictional.</p>

        <p>Within our group, we hold opposing views on delisting policies and hope to present the audience with a balanced survey of material regarding privacy law and internet regulation in this performance. 
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">How do you plan on engaging the public through interactive screen based work?</h5>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Times Square Screen</li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>
              We will utilize this super prime real estate to advertise our services and direct viewers to our website. The ad will be designed to have a super-strong call-to-action to visit our website immediately, perhaps with a time-limited offer? 
            </li></ul>

            <li>Website</li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>This is the core of online presence and will serve as the hub where users can discover ways to interact with the piece via: 
              <ul>
                <li>Chatting to our customer service in-browser</li>
                <li>Tweeting our customer service</li>
                <li>Filling up a “Get Started” form where they can:</li>
                <li>“measure” their online reputation (FREE!)</li>
                <li>Monitor their search engine results</li>
                <li>Flag results out for erasure</li>
                <li>Browse an ironic gallery of satisfied customers</li></ul>
            </li></ul>


            <li>Twitter Bots / Social Media Buzz</li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>
              There will be an automated component of the project in the form of bots that focuses on creating and moderating discussion amongst people interacting with the Time Square screen Or a certain hashtag associated with our project. The idea is to mobilize people around the issue and see where their conversations go.
