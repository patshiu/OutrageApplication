          <span class="quote"><p>“Google has acted as judge, jury and executioner in the wake of Europe’s right to be forgotten ruling. But what does society lose when a private corporation rules public information?”</p></span>

          <span class="attribution"><p>— Julia Powles and Enrique Chaparro, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search
" target="_blank">How Google determined our right to be forgotten</a>, The Guardian, Wednesday 18 February 2015 02.30 EST</p></span>
        
        <p>Our project aims to direct attention to the recent developments in internet regulation in the United States, specifically in relation to “The Right to Be Forgotten”.</p>

        <p>We will do so by creating a web-presence for a fictional delisting service to American consumers. This type of service, already existing in Europe (eg. <a href="http://www.reputationvip.com/" target="_blank">http://www.reputationvip.com/</a> ), claims to help users “control their onine reputation and protect their professional image”  by  delisting search engine results that they feel are negative.</p>

        <p>Because of the regulation governing search engines’ US sites, services like these are not currently a reality in America. As users interact with our false company’s advertisements, online-presence and online customer (bot-driven) service, they will encounter facts and articles about America’s current position in Delisting, and realize that the service is fictional.</p>

        <p>Within our group, we hold opposing views on delisting policies and hope to present the audience with a balanced survey of material regarding privacy law and internet regulation in this performance. 
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">How do you plan on engaging the public through interactive screen based work?</h5>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Times Square Screen</em></li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>
              We will utilize this super prime real estate to advertise our services and direct viewers to our website. The ad will be designed to have a super-strong call-to-action to visit our website immediately, perhaps with a time-limited offer?
            </li></ul>

            <li><em>Website</em></li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>This is the core of online presence and will serve as the hub where users can discover ways to interact with the piece via:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Chatting to our customer service in-browser</li>
                <li>Tweeting our customer service</li>
                <li>Filling up a “Get Started” form where they can:</li>
                <li>“measure” their online reputation (FREE!)</li>
                <li>Monitor their search engine results</li>
                <li>Flag results out for erasure</li>
                <li>Browse an ironic gallery of satisfied customers</li></ul>
            </li></ul>


            <li><em>Twitter Bots / Social Media Buzz</em></li>
            <ul class="noBullets"><li>
              There will be an automated component of the project in the form of bots that focuses on creating and moderating discussion amongst people interacting with the Time Square screen Or a certain hashtag associated with our project. The idea is to mobilize people around the issue and see where their conversations go.
            </li></ul>

      <h5 class="question">Notes from Recce of Times Square</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewers will not see 2 screens at once, content will have to be the same.</li>
        <li>Screen space is vertical, content must be created to utilize whole screen space. 
        LED and super bright. </li>
        <li>There are zero news sources at times square, except for that news ticker on One Times Sq. They are ALL ads. </li>
        <li>Both the viacom screens are at junctions, so they are most likely to catch the gaze of people waiting to cross the street. </li>
        <li>It will be cold AF in January, so we will need some seriously serious incentive to get people to reach for their phones and tap in that URL. </li>
        <li>Surveillance cameras, lots and lots of them. And mostly framing the screens. </li>
        <li>Artifacting will happen when a pic / vid of the screen is taken from a mobile phone. Will not be a significant problem for social media re-sharing BUT keep in mind for documentation!!</li>
        <li>Terrace area above the screen seems to be accessible. </li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="question">Possible Extended Project Scope</h5>
      <ul class="subPara">
        <li><em>“Free” wifi at Times Square that direct people to our site.</em></li>
        <ul class="noBullets"><li>The idea is to access meta data about their devices and use that to deduce some information about them and add it to our screens. This is of course to add an overall paranoia about data. Who owns the data and is it right to broadcast “publicly visible” data and make them consider their lack of ownership and control over their own data.</li></ul>
        <li><em>Promoters handing our freemiums (branded pencil &amp; erasers, detergent, usb sticks, etc.) at Time Square to promote the service</em></li>
        <li><em>Purchasing online ad space (FB, Google, etc) to direct people to our site</em></li>
      </ul>
